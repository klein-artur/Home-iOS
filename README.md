# Home-iOS

This is the app using the API of [ModbusPV](https://github.com/klein-artur/ModbusPV).

There is nothing special to do to make it run, as it is a very simple app. The only thing that is important is to copy the file `constants_draft.swift`, name it `constants.swift` and replacing values in there with your backend infos.
